Account Cash Discount Base
==========================

This module was written to allow you to define cash discount on your customer
or supplier invoice. On customer invoice, you can add a discount delay and
a discount percent. At invoice's validation, the discount due date is genereted
from the delay. The amount with discount deducted is computed at the same time
as taxes. This module also adds cash discount informations on customer invoice
report.

On supplier invoices, you can set the discount percent or directly defined the
total amount with discount deducted. For the discount due date, you can fill it
directly or set a delay. In this case, discount due date is still computed at
invoice's validation.

In all cases, the discount is a percentage of the  untaxed amount.
